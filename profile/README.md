# Welcome to the UCAN Working Group :tickets::zap:

User Controlled Authorization Networks (UCANs) are decentralized, [capabilities model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security) authorization tokens.

UCAN is a trustless, secure, local-first, user-originated authorization and revocation scheme. UCAN is designed to be very flexible: you can use it offline, online, fully P2P, federated, or with central servers.

Please see the [specs](#specs) for more detail.
